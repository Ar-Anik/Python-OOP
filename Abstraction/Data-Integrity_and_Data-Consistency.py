Data Integrity: Data integrity refers to the accuracy, reliability(authenticity), and trustworthiness of data over its lifecycle.
                It ensures that the data remains unaltered and consistent throughout its creation, storage, retrieval,
                and processing phases. Data integrity is maintained by enforcing constraints, validations, and rules
                on the data to prevent unauthorized modifications, deletions, or insertions. This ensures that the data
                accurately represents the real-world information it is intended to reflect.
"""

"""
Data Consistency: Data consistency refers to the uniformity(identity) and coherence of data across different databases, systems, or applications. 
                  In a distributed environment where multiple copies of the same data exist across various platforms, maintaining data 
                  consistency ensures that all copies are updated simultaneously and reflect the same set of values. This prevents 
                  discrepancies or conflicts that may arise due to outdated or conflicting information. Data consistency is typically 
                  achieved through synchronization mechanisms and transaction management protocols to ensure that changes made to the 
                  data are propagated consistently across all systems.

"""

"""
In summary, while data integrity focuses on the correctness and reliability of individual data items, 
data consistency emphasizes the uniformity and coherence of data across multiple sources or systems. 
Both are essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of data in any organization or system.
