'''
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts that allows developers to manage complexity by hiding
the unnecessary details of an object and exposing only the essential features or functionalities. It involves focusing on what an object
does rather than how it achieves what it does.
'''

'''
Abstraction in OOP can be achieved through several mechanisms:

1. Abstract Classes

2. Interfaces

3. Encapsulation

4. Data Hiding: This is a principle of abstraction where the internal details or state of an object are hidden from the outside world. 
   By restricting direct access to an object's data and providing controlled ways to modify it, developers can maintain the integrity 
   and consistency of the object's state.

Abstraction helps in:

1. Managing Complexity: By focusing on the essential aspects of an object and hiding unnecessary details, abstraction simplifies the design 
                        and implementation of complex systems.

2. Code Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces promote code reusability by allowing multiple classes to share common behaviors and 
                     functionalities.

3. Maintainability: Abstraction improves the maintainability of code by reducing dependencies and making it easier to modify 
                    or extend functionalities without affecting other parts of the system.

Overall, abstraction is a powerful concept in OOP that enables developers to create more organized, modular, and maintainable code by 
hiding implementation details and exposing a clear, simplified interface for interacting with objects.
