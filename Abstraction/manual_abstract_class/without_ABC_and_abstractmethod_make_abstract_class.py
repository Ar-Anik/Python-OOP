> Without using ABC and @abstractmethod, Python will not prevent instantiation of the base class.

> When we define a method in a base class that raises NotImplementedError, it's just a normal method that 
raises an error if called. It doesn't force subclasses to implement it. Therefore, our code works until 
we call the missing method.

> we rely on runtime errors, not compile-time enforcement. This approach works, but itâ€™s less clean, safe 
and self-documenting.

"""
Q : When Is This Useful?
> When we want to avoid dependencies on abc.
> For simpler codebases or dynamic situations where we handle enforcement manually.
> When we want maximum flexibility at the cost of strict rules.
