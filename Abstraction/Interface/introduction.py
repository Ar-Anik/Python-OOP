# In python, an interface is an abstract class which contians only abstract method but not a single concrete method.

"""
Interface Rules:

1. All methods of an interface is abstract.

2. We can not create object of interface.

3. If a class does not implement all the methods declared in the interface, the class must be declared abstract.

"""
When use Interface?
    We use interface when all the features need to be implemented differently for different objects.

# Interfaces are slow when compared to abstract class
