When it comes to Monkey Patching in Python, there are some advantages and shortcomings to consider. Here are some benefits:

1. Enhanced Functionality
Monkey Patching allows developers and QAEs to extend the functionality of existing codebases without directly modifying them.
This enables swift prototyping and experimentation with new features or modifications, leading to faster iterations and reduced
development time.

2. Bug Fixes and Missing Features
Monkey Patching is valuable when fixing bugs or adding missing features in third-party libraries or modules. It provides a way
to address issues in code that may no longer be actively maintained or where direct modification is impractical.

3. Saves Time
Ideal for quickly addressing bugs or issues in libraries when you cannot wait for an official patch or update.


Despite the benefits of using Monkey Patching, here are some of the shortcomings:

1. Unintended Side Effects
Monkey Patching introduces the risk of unintended side effects or conflicts due to the dynamic modification of existing code at
runtime. This can make the codebase harder to understand, affecting maintainability, readability, and debugging efforts.

2. Context-Specific Changes
Monkey patches are often written to address specific problems or modify behavior in a limited scope, making them unsuitable for
general-purpose reuse.

3. Hidden Dependencies
Monkey-patched code may rely on the internals of the target module or class, which can change in future updates, breaking the patch.

4. Poor Maintainability
Reusable code is ideally clean, well-documented, and easy to integrate. Monkey patches are often ad hoc and lack the clarity needed
for effective reuse.

5. Non-Portable
A monkey patch modifies a specific class or module at runtime, which might not behave consistently across different environments or projects.

6. Testing Complexity
The patched behavior may not be readily apparent within the original codebase, making it more challenging to test and verify the
correctness of the modified code.

In summary, Monkey Patching offers advantages such as enhanced functionality, bug fixes, and code reusability. However, it also
introduces challenges related to unintended side effects and testing complexity. By understanding and carefully considering these
advantages and shortcomings, developers and QAEs can make good decisions about when and how to apply Monkey Patching effectively
in their projects.
