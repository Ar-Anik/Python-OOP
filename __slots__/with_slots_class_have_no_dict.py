"""
In Python, the __slots__ mechanism is used to prevent the automatic creation of a __dict__ for instances of a class,
thereby saving memory by avoiding the overhead associated with dynamic attribute management. Normally, instances of Python
classes store their attributes in a dictionary (__dict__). However, by using __slots__, you define a fixed set of attributes
for each instance, and the instance wonâ€™t have a __dict__ attribute.
