"""
When we create a function using the def keyword or the lambda keyword, Python internally creates an object of function class.
which means this object type is function. This function object includes several attributes and references, such as:

1. The code object (__code__): Contains the compiled bytecode of the function.

2. The function's name (__name__): A reference to the name of the function.

3. The docstring (__doc__): A reference to the function's documentation string, if provided.

4. The module (__module__): A reference to the module in which the function was defined.

5. Defaults for arguments (__defaults__): Contains the default values for the function's parameters.

6. Closure (__closure__): Contains references to any variables captured in the function's closure (in the case of nested functions or lambdas).

7. Globals (__globals__): A reference to the global namespace in which the function was defined.

when we assign a function to another variable, Python does not create a new function objectâ€”it creates a new reference to the same function object.

Q : What Is a Code Object?
--> A code object in Python represents the internal compiled bytecode of a function, method, or module. The bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent 
representation of your code, which the Python interpreter executes.
